Exercise 2.14: Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate
the behavior of the system on a variety of arithmetic ex-
pressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them in
computing the expressions A/A and A/B. You will get the
most insight by using intervals whose width is a small per-
centage of the center value. Examine the results of the com-
putation in center-percent form (see Exercise 2.12).
